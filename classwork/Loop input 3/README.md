# Loop input 3

**Topic: The calculation process of the final score of the simulated final, the requirements are as follows:**

1. First enter the number of judges, and use try-except to prevent input exceptions. If the number of judges is less than 2, it will prompt that there are too few judges;

2.Then enter the scores of each judge in turn, and use try-except to ensure that the entered scores are all between 0-10, otherwise it will prompt an error score;

3. Remove the highest score, remove the lowest score, and output the final average score.
