New yearï¼Œnew life.

Looking into your past is the only way to discover your future.

You have to love yourself.

Everyone loves something.

We learn from our mistakes.

Self-improvement is a lifelong process.

You must trust yourself.

Be who you are on the inside.

When you only have one life, that's what makes it special.

I belive in you.

You could be happy in your warm winter coat.

It's nice to have a friend.

Listen to your heart.

No one is born good or bad.

You are the love of my life.

Each day brings a new beginning.
